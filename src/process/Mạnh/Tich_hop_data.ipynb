Well, as for my experience here , I requested high floor , quiet rooms, non smoking and good cold Aircond. Upon check in (arrived 530pm) they passed me the keys to level 2 , 207.. the corner room facing staircase . Well, my 3 nights stay there is OK, just that Aircond is not working well. It is cool when you just started using it. After few hours , means while you were sound asleep somewhere 3-4am, Aircond turns warm... I did complain and they came and check seems like nothing wrong to their system.. anyway, we restart the Aircond , take out room key from the key slot , off everything. And slot in again switch on Aircond and wait for it to start cooling again .. this will take another 30minutes to get cooling ... this is the only Disadvantages.... Breakfast ok Wifi ok Distance to Ben Thanh mkt is perfect .. We walked to Notre Dame, Central Post office , Hard Rock Cafe & independence palace within 15 minutes .',\n",

This is my first time staying at an automatic homestay, there is no reception, host or supervisor. Instructions for checking in / out are very detailed and easy to understand. Room similar in the 99% picture. Rooms are arranged, arranged neatly, lovely but not too clean. Old shower, 3 faucets that can be opened only 1, with hot water, shower gel, full hand soap. The toilet kit has been opened or is old and has not been replaced. The kitchen is very neat and full of the most basic necessities. The refrigerator is super cold. 2 bottles of pretty small spring water attached with the label of the homestay are very cute and free (also print the words not for sale, the owner is very thoughtful). The bed is soft and comfortable. Air conditioner has a problem at noon, every noon is hot indescribably despite having the strongest mode at 18 ° C, from 16h onwards new cool machines as usual. Wifi is not very stable. Great TV. The door of the room has only 1 unique lock, the key has only 1 key, so being alone is a bit insecure. It would be nice if I could do additional door locks. Overall, the homestay is quite comfortable, convenient, quiet. I had a pretty good experience here because all I need is a good air conditioner, strong wifi, quiet, privacy and good security. Hopefully, if you have the opportunity to meet again, the next time you meet, the homestay will be more complete. Thank the landlord and her cleaning a lot. Good health.',\n",

Room is in very good condition + very clean, almost like in the pictures (looks same, NOT 10 years old pictures and different reality after check-in :). Air condition is built-in style, works very good and quiet. Hotel has very fast lift. Internet router in every room, independent router per room. Speed 60/100mbps, works very good. Rooms from street side (little noisy) and rooms with window \"to the wall\" but with flowers and VERY QUIET (room not from street side). Hotel is in the really hanoi center. Nice food close to the hotel and vinmart about 200m. Friendly stuff (good English). Highly recommend.',\n",

Nhân viên giống với bảo vệ hơn là lễ tân. iii. Khu vực lễ tân được đặt ở sảnh được thiết kế sử dụng cho cafe & khu để xe. (Buổi tối nhận phòng mình thấy khu lễ tân là khu gửi xe máy, mình trả phòng sớm lúc 6h & ở 1 đêm nên không rõ ban ngày thế nào) 3. Về tiện ích và nội thất phòng: - Phòng thiết kế dạng Apartment nên có khu vực nấu ăn (nhỏ, khá bí, phù hợp đun nước nấu mì tôm hoặc hâm nóng đồ ăn với lò vi sóng). - Cửa không có khóa từ - giống với kiểu khách sạn cũ những năm 2011. - Đồ đạc: khá cũ kĩ - Restroom: khá rộng, không có vách ngăn giữa phòng tắm & khu vệ sinh, sạch sẽ, thiết kế theo những năm 2011. Tổng quan: - Giá quá hợp lý với vị trí nằm ở khu trung tâm - Tuy nhiên nếu là khách hàng quan tâm đến tính an toàn & chút yêu cầu về nội thất thì cần cân nhắc. *** Sẽ không quay lại.',\n",

Breakfast is ok even though they didn’t serve halal food, but the manager is being helpful to tell us which food that we should avoid. Room is clean, but mine has no view (even though it has a window), so the light is a bit dark in my room. Location is great & superb, there’s a Masjid Jamik nearby & not hard to find halal food in Ben Nghe. I hope Bong Sen will have a room for 4 people in the future, so me & my family don’t have to pay for the extra bed',\n",

Overall, stay was good, breakfast was very good but I hope the customer-service part could've improve. Thank you\",\n",

       "   'content': 'I had a really bad experience, I have to say that for the first time since I booked my room I met that situation. I booked 3 days and 3 nights in an apartment-style room, the first 2 nights were very good, nice room, comfortable. Everything started on the second day when the staff informed me that my room had an appointment before that day, there was a mechanic to come to fix the room (and later I asked carefully that those guys asked the mechanic to come to fix before the day I checked in, meaning was the employee who let me in the room I had booked but definitely one thing I couldn\\'t stay for 3 nights, strange), and she suggested that morning I had to move my room to another nearby building, ban my head is ok because I\\'m quite easy going, the problem is that the new room is completely different from the old room: smaller room, no bathtub, no dining table, tiny kitchen area. At this point, 2 staff members began to convince themselves that this room was the same room, this room was the most beautiful. At this point I started to react because this was not an objective reason, I booked 3 nights but you still made an appointment to fix the room, rather than a sudden I could sympathize, but this was in the plan of all of you. And the female staff was like \"you have to sympathize with us, we already helped you change rooms and what else do you ask for\". Hey, I booked the room and paid in advance, it is your responsibility to ensure the room for me, not thanks. After I had no other way, I had to search for the price of the two sides, and of course the room that you guys forced me to stay in was 192k less than the room I had paid to stay. Strange yet? At that time, all of my friends would stop arguing with me and then I said that I wanted to meet the manager, so my manager said I was so impatient that I didn\\'t want to talk. At the end of the movie, that friend gave me 192k of difference, I lost all my interest in the vacation that was supposed to be fun, lost the whole morning (or I was free), and then you said “now who is right to argue with who is right? unnecessarily wrong ”. That\\'s right, there\\'s no need to argue anymore !!! The good thing is that after I searched the internet, I found 9 similar cases, that is, book room of Jack 85 but then was taken to another hotel, most of them were too tired and had to accept, there was a case on my skin that reacted like me, got a refund and then got sued by the boss with * g * da that these were horrible guests and I hope * g * da don\\'t serve the guests this. Therefore, when writing this review, I have to tell the details, otherwise the hotel will paralyze me in case the horrible customer refuses to serve. The argument of the hotel is that the hotel has already refunded the bad review. But to be honest, your service is completely unacceptable. In addition, when I moved to a new room, those guys hated me so I didn\\'t give them any water =))) I really didn\\'t think that in Saigon, there was a bad hotel.',\n",

Check in the room, there is not any 1 glass of water to drink, not even a glass of water to brush teeth. in the kitchen, there is a full kitchen pot, but there is no bowl, chopsticks, or basketry. The receptionist called to hurry up and bring up 2 temporary sets. until the next day, thinking it was peaceful, I was asked by the receptionist to change my room to a twin room, of course I disagreed, then asked me when it was off, I said at 12 o'clock he turned off like bocking, you told him As soon as possible help me, I need room. I started to reach the climax of my frustration, as if I were being kicked out of my room for a rent. of course i don't agree Right after that, the receptionist still went up to the place to ask me to change room, I disagree, then the receptionist also called the manager to change room.

We were in a group of 4 girls and stayed in 2 units of Sanouva Deluxe Double Room on 24/9 - 26/9. 1. Excellent customer services. We were impressed by all the staff within the hotel. They greeted us with smile and make sure we had a great stay in the hotel. Special to mention their receptionist, Trân is very friendly and polite. She is very helpful to provide us lots of travel information. Staff named Hieu take initiative in helping us to carry our luggage to roadside and accompany us while waiting for our Uber. He is so caring to remind us to be careful and take care of our belongings in airport. Great staff that know the true value of customer service. Thumbs up for all the staff in Sanuova Saigon Hotel. Hope that the management values them as much as we did. 2. Great location. Sanouva Saigon Hotel is located right in the center of the city. It\\'s only 3 mins walk to the famous Ben Thanh Street Food Market, 5 mins walk to Ben Thanh Market and Pho 2000. Most of the tourist attractions are within walking distance too. Circle K convenience shop is just next to the hotel. 3. Continental breakfast buffet was excellent, we liked the breakfast very much, include some Vietnamese food for example \"Pho\". All these food was so delicious. Though we\\'d enjoy our breakfast during our stayed in this little hotel. 4. 3-star prices, but 5-star comfort amenities. The room itself was well equipped in modern style, very clean and spacious too. Extra comfortable king size bedding and comfy pillows, thus every night we had a very good sleep during our stayed in this hotel. Water pressure in the bathroom was very strong, we love it so much. Although short and sweet this time, we hope to be back for a longer visit in the future. A great place to stay while on your visit to Ho Chi Minh City. Highly recommended hotel in Ho Chi Minh City. Definitely will come back for next time! Thank you, Sanouva Saigon Hotel!',\n",

Tuy nhiên điểm trừ là phòng cách âm hơi kém, nhưng mình cũng không phiền vấn đề này lắm. Có một lưu ý nhỏ là thềm cửa hơi khó chạy xe lên một chút phải cẩn thận.',\n",

I asked the receptionist and got the answer: just leave it on the web but I don't really have it. The cabinet is broken. Such a big hotel and the refrigerator is out of order ??? When I checked in, the receptionist sat and called me back and forth many times at the counter to confirm that I had paid to the hotel owner. and after I showed the receptionist's voucher, the receptionist was still trying to scrutinize me to see if I actually paid the room charge. From the beginning to the end, I always look like a person who cheats at the inn. while i book and pay via visa card ??? oh my god. terribly bad.
